## What is Syntax?
***
- In simplest words, Syntax is the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. In the case of a computer language, the syntax is the structural arrangement of comments, variables, numbers, operators, statements, loops, functions, classes, objects, etc. which helps us understand the meaning or semantics of a computer language.
- For E.g. a ‘comment’ is used to explain the functioning of a block of code. It starts with a ‘#’. More on comments in the comments chapter.
- For E.g. a block of code is identified by an ‘indentation’. Have a look at the following code, here print(i) is said to be indented with respect to the link above it. In simple words, indentation is the addition of spaces before the line "print(i)"

## Python Indentation
- Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
- Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
- Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
```bash
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
  ```
- Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
```bash
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")
```
- The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
